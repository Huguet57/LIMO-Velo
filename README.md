## News! ðŸŽ‰
- [Carlos](https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335) is working on [LIMOncello](https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335/LIMOncello) that improves the Lie Algebra of the Kalman Filter, is written in functional code and has thread safety just like [Fast-LIMO](https://github.com/fetty31/fast_LIMO). Better, safer and simpler!
- [Oriol](https://github.com/fetty31) just released [Fast-LIMO](https://github.com/fetty31/fast_LIMO) - a thread-safe and fast implementation of LIMO-Velo!
- Now with a ROS2 branch, `ros2` - thanks to [bertaveira](https://github.com/bertaveira). Broader LiDARs support is needed.
- [bertaveira](https://github.com/bertaveira) is also working on a [LIMO-Velo++](https://github.com/bertaveira/LIMO_Velo) with python bindings. Check out his work in progress!

## A real-time LiDAR-Inertial SLAM for high velocities in spinning LiDARs.

  Visualization of the algorithm with <code>delta = 0.01</code> (100Hz)
</p>

Designed for easy modifying via modular and easy to understand code. Relying upon [HKU-Mars](https://github.com/hku-mars)'s [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM) and [ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) open-source libraries. Based also on their [FAST_LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO).

### Tested and made for racing at Formula Student Driverless
Common working speeds are 20m/s in straights and 100deg/s in the turns.

  Tested on and made for Barcelona's own "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly_ax8w-T7E&feature=emb_logo">Xaloc</a>".
</p>

### Centimeter-level accuracy is kept under racing speeds
Only algorithm that can deliver centimeter-level resolution on real-time. See the part of my thesis where I explain the algorithm and its results: [LIMOVelo + Results](https://github.com/Huguet57/LIMO-Velo/blob/main/config/docs/Thesis%20-%20LIMOVelo%20%2B%20Results.pdf).

  Comparison of cones under racing speeds running all algorithms in real-time, except for LIO-SAM (-r 0.5). It failed otherwise.
</p>

### Designed to be easily understood even by beginners
Developing an algorithm for a team requires the algorithm to be easy enough to understand being passed through generations.

# LiDARs supported
- Velodyne
- Hesai
- Ouster
- Livox (check ``livox`` git branch)

# Dependencies
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) (tested on 18.04, 20.04)
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (tested on Melodic, Noetic)
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [PCL](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html) (tested on 1.8)

# Newest additions
## High Quality Maps
Sometimes a higher map quality is needed, now a new ``high_quality_publish`` parameter has been added to yield results like this below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./config/docs/img/high-quality-cones.png" alt="High quality cones" /><br />
  Sometimes Xaloc needs more definition to see if a cluster of points is actually a cone.
</p>

## Work in progress (branch ``hdmaps``)
<p align="center">
  <img src="./config/docs/img/prelocalization-hdmaps.gif" alt="Prelocalizing with a given HD map" /><br />
  Prelocalization with a previoulsy saved HD map. Still work in progress on the <code>hdmaps</code> branch. Official release will be in a couple of days.

# Sample datasets
<p align="center">
  <img src="./config/docs/img/rosbag-xaloc.gif" alt="Xaloc's fast dataset" /><br />
  Xaloc's "fast" dataset. High velocity in the straights (~15m/s) and tight turns (~80deg/s).
</p>

Try ``xaloc.launch`` with Xaloc's own rosbags.
- :checkered_flag: Find a ``slow`` (818MB) and a ``fast`` (1.71GB) run in [this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4116xoc7srps6a5/AAC3q1h50swG7fRMI3USNn2la?dl=0).

See Issue [#10](https://github.com/Huguet57/LIMO-Velo/issues/10) to see other sample datasets found in the web.
Don't hesitate to ask there for more data on specific scenarios/cases.

# Using LIMO-Velo

## 0. Cloning the repository
When cloning the repository, we also need to clone the [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM) and [ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) submodules. Hence we will use the ``--recurse-submodules`` tag.

``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Huguet57/LIMO-Velo.git``

## 1. Compiling the code
We either can do ``catkin_make`` or ``catkin build`` to compile the code. By default it will compile it optimized already

## 2. Running LIMO-Velo
To run LIMO-Velo, we can run the launch file ``roslaunch limovelo test.launch`` if we want a visualization or ``roslaunch limovelo run.launch`` if we want it without.

### 2.1 Debugging LIMO-Velo
An additional launch file ``roslaunch limovelo debug.launch`` is added that uses [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) as a analysing tool to check for leaks and offers detailed anaylsis of program crashes.

## 3. Changing parameters
To adapt LIMO-Velo to our own hardware infrastructure, a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file ``config/params.yaml`` is available and we need to change it to our own topic names and sensor specs.

Relevant parameters are:
- ``real_time`` if you want to get real time experience.
- ``mapping_offline`` is on an pre-alpha stage and it does not work 100% as it should of.
- ``initialization`` which you can choose how you want the initialization of the pointcloud sizes (sizes =: deltas, in seconds).

## 4. Modifying the LiDAR driver to get true real-time performance
*TODO* - This section is intended to explain how to modify the LiDAR driver to increase its frequency by publishing parts of the pointcloud instead of waiting for all of it.

# TODO list
### Fixes in progress
- [ ] Work with 9-DOF IMUs
- [ ] Saving and loading HD-Maps (needs 9-DOF done)
- [ ] Adding GPS as extra input
- [ ] Rethink ``mapping_offline`` (see Discussions)

### Design choices
- [ ] Renew Buffer private structure. Interesting answer in StackOverflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/67236232](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67236232)
- [ ] Simplify the upsampling in the Compensator.

### Fixes to investigate
- [ ] Interpolation and smoothing of states when mapping offline
- [ ] Erase unused (potentially dangerous) points in the map
- [ ] Check if need to add point in map
- [ ] Try to add a module for removing dynamic objects such as people or vehicles
- [ ] Use UKF instead of EKF
- [ ] Add vision buffer and ability to paint the map's points
- [ ] Initialize IMU measurements
